    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a specific realization of the class with its own set of values for the attributes defined by the class and its own implementation of the methods defined by the class.\n",

    "Let's take an example of a class called Person to understand this concept better. The Person class can have attributes such as name, age, and gender, and methods such as get_name(), get_age(), and get_gender(). We can create objects of the Person class with specific values for the attributes.\n",
